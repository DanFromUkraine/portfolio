You can use npm or pnpm(pnpm is more prefered).

Just run ``` pnpm i  ``` ``` pnpm dev ```

TODOs: 
1. Add ids to all elements that can be mapped for render, so I don't use map index for that, as it is bad practice
2. Add another way to interact with website, using just keyboard, for users with disabilities, who cannot use a mouse
